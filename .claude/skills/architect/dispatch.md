# Builder dispatch reference

Dispatch turns a frozen slice into fresh builder or judge work. The
orchestrator chooses the job shape, model tier, worktree, and report path;
the subagent receives a self-contained task and returns raw evidence.

Verified local Codex facts from the v3 evidence remain useful for the Codex
backend path: the model slug is `gpt-5.5`; `--search` and
`-a/--ask-for-approval` are top-level `codex --help` flags, not `codex exec`
flags; `codex exec` is non-interactive; Goal Mode subcommands are bare
`/goal`, `/goal pause|resume|clear`.

## Model alias table

| Alias | Flags | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `claude/fable` | `--model fable --effort xhigh` | Claude Fable 5 — frontier creative/reasoning model. Default orchestrator and builder. |
| `claude/opus` | `--model opus --effort xhigh` | Claude Opus 4.8 — strongest single-pass judgment and build. |
| `claude/best` | `--model opus --effort xhigh` | Alias for opus — kept for upstream compat. |
| `claude/sonnet` | `--model sonnet --effort high` | Claude Sonnet 5 — fast, capable, cost-effective builder. |
| `claude/haiku` | `--model haiku --effort high` | Claude Haiku 4.5 — cheap mechanical patches only. |
| `claude/tier-down` | `--model sonnet --effort high` | One step down from the frontier; Sonnet at high effort. |
| `codex/best` | `-m gpt-5.5 -c model_reasoning_effort="xhigh"` | Frontier Codex row. Only used when Codex CLI is installed. |
| `codex/tier-down` | `-m gpt-5.5 -c model_reasoning_effort="high"` | Effort-down on the frontier Codex model. |

Tier-down rule: same family, one step down. For Claude: Fable/Opus -> Sonnet;
Sonnet -> Haiku (only when the orchestrator explicitly chooses that risk). For
Codex: effort xhigh -> high on the frontier model. Dispatch blocks print
explicit pinned flags in every command; this table is the source of those pins.

Model IDs for reference: `claude-fable-5`, `claude-opus-4-8`, `claude-sonnet-5`,
`claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`. Use these when passing `--model` to Claude Code.

## Model resolution and dispatch rules

Role strings are `<cli>/<model-spec>[:<effort>]`, with `<cli>` in `{claude,
codex}`. Resolution order per role is repo `.architect/config`, then user
`~/.architect/config`, then defaults: orchestrator = the running session;
builders default is **claude-first** — `claude/fable` (Fable 5 at xhigh)
as the default builder; if Codex CLI is on PATH, `codex/best` is available
as an alternative. Flat `key = value` lines are the supported format for
role keys. Unknown keys warn and never fail.

Optional dispatch-rules lines route task classes to a builder tier:

```ini
# .architect/config or ~/.architect/config
orchestrator = claude/fable
builders = claude/fable
when trivial mechanical edit -> claude/haiku:low    # cheap exact patch
when broad ambiguous refactor -> claude/opus:xhigh  # deepest reasoning
when parallel research -> claude/sonnet:high        # fast coverage work
when cross-family review -> codex/best:xhigh        # blind-spot diversity (requires Codex CLI)
```

Format: `when <task-class description> -> <cli>/<model-spec>[:<effort>] # why`.
The trailing reason is optional but preferred. Absent file = the claude-first
default above. Absent dispatch rules = the claude-first default. A matching
rule is still a judgment aid; the orchestrator records which rule was used
and may override it with a reason recorded on the issue.

Configured builders CLI absent at preflight -> fall back to `claude/tier-down`
(Sonnet at high) and write one tracking-issue comment naming requested vs
substituted. Cross-family review backend absent -> run review in a fresh
same-CLI context and log the same-family bias caveat. Never hard-fail on
model availability alone. Tier is fixed at decomposition by config plus
dispatch rules and never moves because a job failed; a failure is the
orchestrator's diagnosis job, not a retry-at-a-different-tier job (see
`loop.md` "## Failure ladder").

## Per-harness delegation

| | Claude Code (CLI + Desktop) | Codex (CLI + app) |
|---|---|---|
| Builder | Agent tool with `.claude/agents/architect-builder.md`; `disallowedTools` denies `Bash(git commit *)` and `Bash(git push *)`; `isolation: worktree`; `background: true`; model may be passed per invocation from the alias table. On the desktop app, the harness auto-creates the agent's isolation worktree (`.claude/worktrees/agent-<id>`) and its branch — integrate from that branch. On the CLI, spawns have been observed to run UNISOLATED in the orchestrator's checkout despite `isolation: worktree` frontmatter (D11) — pass isolation explicitly per invocation if supported, and never run two Claude-backend builder jobs concurrently unless each is verified to have its own worktree (`git worktree list` after spawn). In all cases, never pre-create a job worktree for Claude-backend jobs (a pre-made one is ignored); do not use `.architect/wt/<slice>-<NN>` (that pattern is Codex-backend only, below). | `spawn_agent` with defensive framing: "Your task is: ..."; worktree created by the orchestrator via git; use `/goal` semantics for persistent job completion. |
| Judge | Agent tool with `.claude/agents/architect-judge.md`; read-only tools plus Bash for check commands; orchestrator tier via `model: inherit` or per-invocation model. | Fresh `spawn_agent` with read-only instructions and the fixed judge template. |
| Monitor | Script watchdog (`watchdog.ps1` on Windows, `watchdog.sh` on POSIX) when the orchestrator can run background processes and receive exit notifications; LLM fallback template only otherwise. | Script watchdog (`watchdog.ps1` on Windows, `watchdog.sh` on POSIX) when background process exits wake the orchestrator; LLM fallback template only otherwise and it counts as one of the 6 `max_threads`. |
| Parallelism | Background subagents; permission prompts surface to the main session. | Native subagents, `max_threads` 6, `max_depth` 1 (root session is depth 0; a spawned child may not spawn further — no nested orchestrators, the orchestrator dispatches builders directly), `wait_agent` for completion (the live collab event stream names the underlying tool call `wait`, not `wait_agent` — evidence: v4-codex CG4 architect-run canary `events.jsonl`). |
| Review (high-stakes) | `codex review --base` when Codex is installed; otherwise a fresh same-CLI subagent with bias caveat. | `/review` / `review_model`; Claude reviewer when installed. |
| Skill packaging | `skills/architect/` plus Claude skill install locations. | `.agents/skills/architect/SKILL.md` (and any other `skills/*/`); same source text copied by installer. |

D9 note: the desktop harness strips the Bash tool from spawned subagents by
name; both agent defs now carry `PowerShell` as the desktop-safe executor
(still padded interior per the position guard above). Job and judge reports
must name which executor — Bash or PowerShell — ran each check command.

D12 note: CLI subagent tool strips have also been observed intermittent and
definition-asymmetric — not the desktop's Bash-only D9 pattern. A fresh
builder spawn once kept both shell tools while two same-session judge spawns
lost both and correctly returned INVALID. Working mitigation (`DESIGN.md`): a
cross-family codex judge for shell-dependent checks, plus a fresh headless
`claude -p` session for any check the codex sandbox cannot run at all. A
builder in this position records the exact missing tools and its substitute,
or reports the check BLOCKED — never silently skips a check or invents output.

## C5 judge delegation template

The orchestrator must send this template as-is except for replacing
placeholders. It must not add slice-specific prose, encouragement, summaries,
or interpretation. Judge intent context is pointer-only: frozen check file,
spec pointer, job report, and `docs/jobs/<issue-slug>-rulings.md`
(orchestrator-owned, append-only; absent = no post-freeze rulings).

<!-- architect-judge-template:start -->
```text
Frozen check file path: <docs/checks/<slice>.md>
Freeze commit SHA: <freeze-sha>
Branch to judge: <branch>
Spec pointer: <spec path named by the frozen check>
Job report: <docs/jobs/<issue-slug>-01.md>
Rulings file: docs/jobs/<issue-slug>-rulings.md (absent = no post-freeze rulings)

Verdict format:
- Checks integrity: PASS | FAIL | INVALID
  Raw evidence: <git diff <freeze-sha>..HEAD -- docs/checks/>
- Diff vs intent: PASS | FAIL | INVALID
  Raw evidence: <file:line evidence from the diff and frozen check/spec text>
- Per check:
  - <check id>: PASS | FAIL | INVALID
    Command: <exact command from the frozen check>
    Raw evidence: <verbatim stdout/stderr and exit code>
- Slice verdict: PASS | FAIL | INVALID
  Decisive reason: <one sentence tied to raw evidence>
```
<!-- architect-judge-template:end -->

## Codex judge delegation template

The orchestrator must send this template as-is except for replacing the check
file path, freeze SHA, branch, and worktree note. It must not add slice-specific
prose, encouragement, summaries, or interpretation.

<!-- architect-codex-judge-template:start -->
```text
Frozen check file path: <docs/checks/<slice>.md>
Freeze commit SHA: <freeze-sha>
Branch to judge: <branch>
Worktree note: <worktree note>

You are a fresh read-only judge. You did not build this job. Flag only gaps
that affect correctness, the stated requirements, or documented project
invariants -- cite file:line evidence for every finding. Do not report
stylistic preferences.

Tree audit: workspace-write exists only so validators can run. Any tracked-file
modification during judgment means the verdict is discarded INVALID.

Sanctioned substitutions, recorded per check: Git Bash CreateFileMapping Win32
error 5 -> PowerShell same-pattern; uv AppData cache denial -> run with
`UV_CACHE_DIR=.architect/tmp/uv-cache`; gh unavailable -> report
`MIRROR: ORCHESTRATOR`.

Intent context pointers: frozen check file above; spec pointer named by the
frozen check; job report named by the issue/check; rulings file
`docs/jobs/<issue-slug>-rulings.md` (absent = no post-freeze rulings).

Verdict format:
- Checks integrity: PASS | FAIL | INVALID
  Raw evidence: <git diff <freeze-sha>..HEAD -- docs/checks/>
- Diff vs intent: PASS | FAIL | INVALID
  Raw evidence: <file:line evidence from the diff and frozen check/spec text>
- Per check:
  - <check id>: PASS | FAIL | INVALID
    Command: <exact command from the frozen check>
    Executor: <executor used>
    Raw evidence: <verbatim stdout/stderr and exit code>
- Slice verdict: PASS | FAIL | INVALID
  Decisive reason: <one sentence tied to raw evidence>
```
<!-- architect-codex-judge-template:end -->

## Stress-test delegation template

The orchestrator must send this template as-is except for replacing
placeholders. It must not add slice-specific prose, encouragement, summaries,
or interpretation.

<!-- architect-stress-test-template:start -->
```text
Draft check file path: <docs/checks/<slice>.md>
Branch: <branch>
Issue bodies: <pasted issue bodies for this plan>

Task: try to falsify this draft. Execute each check command against the
current tree, verify every referenced path/SHA/pointer resolves, attack each
acceptance criterion and pasted issue bodies against the spec for
contradictions and non-falsifiability, including patterns that collide with
repo realities (e.g. a grep pattern matching the repo's own name), and flag any
assumption not evidenced in the repo. For every file a job deletes or renames,
grep the whole repo for references and verify the owning job's boundary covers
them or a dependency edge orders the fix. For every NEW artifact path a job
will create, run `git check-ignore <path>` and flag the plan if ignored.

Defect report format:
- <check id or clause>: FALSIFIED | HOLDS
  Evidence: <command run and verbatim output, or file:line>
- Plan findings: <delete/rename reference and ignored-new-path findings, or none>
- Assumptions not evidenced in the repo: <list or none>
```
<!-- architect-stress-test-template:end -->

## Codex backend from a Claude orchestrator

The worktree pre-creation and dispatch commands in this section are
Codex-backend only. Claude-backend jobs never pre-create a worktree — see
the Per-harness delegation table above.

When the orchestrator is Claude Code and the chosen builders backend is Codex, write the
builder block to a file first, then pass it via stdin (`-`). Big prompt blocks
contain quotes that shells, especially Windows PowerShell, can mangle.

Single-job slice in the current checkout, resolved builders `codex/best`:

```bash
codex exec -C <repo-root> --sandbox workspace-write \
  -m gpt-5.5 -c model_reasoning_effort="xhigh" \
  --json -o .architect/last-run.md \
  - < .architect/dispatch-block.md
```

If the effort call resolves to `codex/tier-down`, change only the effort pin:

```bash
codex exec -C <repo-root> --sandbox workspace-write \
  -m gpt-5.5 -c model_reasoning_effort="high" \
  --json -o .architect/last-run.md \
  - < .architect/dispatch-block.md
```

For 2-4 jobs, the orchestrator owns worktree creation and parallelism:

```bash
git -C <repo-root> worktree add .architect/wt/<slice>-<NN> \
  -b job/<slice>-<NN> <freeze-sha>

codex exec -C <repo-root>/.architect/wt/<slice>-<NN> --sandbox workspace-write \
  -m gpt-5.5 -c model_reasoning_effort="xhigh" \
  --json -o .architect/wt/<slice>-<NN>.last-run.md \
  - < .architect/wt/<slice>-<NN>.block.md
```

A worktree's `.git` is a pointer file and the resolved git dir is
sandbox-protected too. Builders cannot commit or touch shared history from any
job; nothing reaches a branch until orchestrator checks pass.

## Integration commands

Integration is architect-only, after per-job post-flight passes. The
`.architect/wt/<slice>-<NN>` paths below are Codex-backend only. For
Claude-backend jobs, skip `worktree add`/`worktree remove`; commit inside
the harness's auto-created worktree, then
`git -C <repo-root> merge --no-ff <agent-worktree-branch>` from the agent
worktree's branch:

```bash
git -C <repo-root> checkout -b slice/<name> <freeze-sha>
git -C <repo-root>/.architect/wt/<slice>-<NN> add -A
git -C <repo-root>/.architect/wt/<slice>-<NN> commit -m "job <NN>: <what>"
git -C <repo-root> merge --no-ff job/<slice>-<NN>
<run the check commands>
git -C <repo-root> worktree remove .architect/wt/<slice>-<NN>
git -C <repo-root> branch -d job/<slice>-<NN>
```

A merge conflict means the job plan was not disjoint. Kill the conflicting
job and re-spec; do not hand-resolve builder conflicts.

## Issue conventions

Claim is an orchestrator action, never a builder action: the orchestrator is
the single dispatcher and assigns exactly one issue per job immediately
before spawning its builder. A builder never self-claims or picks its own
next issue.

On current backends, builders usually cannot post to issues: Codex has no
network, and Claude subagents have a shell-strip watch item. `MIRROR:
ORCHESTRATOR` is the normal mode; the orchestrator mirrors at event boundaries
it already occupies. Direct builder posting stays permitted where supported.

```bash
gh issue edit <n> --add-assignee "@me"   # orchestrator claims, before dispatch
```

Builder comments on its own issue are limited to four kinds, never one per
commit:

- One PHASE-0 disagreements comment, before building.
- `BLOCKED: <exact blocker> + what I tried` (a blocker is a completion event).
- One milestone comment, only if the job is long enough to warrant one.
- The final STATUS mirror (the job report's status line, verbatim).

```bash
gh issue comment <n> --body "PHASE 0: <disagreements, or what I checked>"
gh issue comment <n> --body "BLOCKED: <exact blocker> + <what I tried>"
gh issue comment <n> --body "MILESTONE: <what completed so far>"
gh issue comment <n> --body "STATUS: <the report's exact status line>"
```

Orchestrator comments on the sub-issue: rulings, blocker answers, and the
judge verdict + decisive reason at close. The batched escalation digest goes
on the tracking issue only, never on a sub-issue.

```bash
gh issue comment <n> --body "RULING: <decision> - <one line why>"
gh issue comment <n> --body "ANSWER: <blocker answer>"
gh issue comment <n> --body "VERDICT: PASS|FAIL|INVALID - <decisive reason>"
gh issue comment <tracking-issue-n> --body "DIGEST: <batched escalations + run summary>"
```

Cadence and size hold regardless of author: comments land at least 1 minute
apart, each under 65,000 characters, and never one per commit (GitHub
secondary rate limits). A running builder does NOT re-read issue comments
mid-job — the issue is the durable log, not a channel the builder polls; an
answer reaches the builder only through a fresh respawn's spawn context (see
"Respawn-with-answer template").

## Monitor dispatch

The orchestrator writes one watchdog config JSON per dispatch wave, then
launches the platform script as a background process: `watchdog.ps1` on
Windows, `watchdog.sh` on POSIX. The config uses the spec's Interface
contract:

```json
{
  "sweep_sec": 120,
  "stall_after_min": 10,
  "jobs": [
    { "id": "issue-31", "events_file": "<path>", "report_path": "<path>",
      "worktree": "<path>", "duration_hint_min": 0 }
  ]
}
```

The watchdog detects mechanically; the orchestrator supplies the reasoning.
The watchdog never kills, nudges, or judges. It exits with typed evidence:

| Exit | Prefix | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | `WATCHDOG: ALL_DONE` | every job report exists, with path and byte size evidence |
| 2 | `WATCHDOG: INTEGRATED` | a job worktree or events file vanished because the orchestrator integrated it mid-sweep |
| 3 | `WATCHDOG: STALL` | file growth and process activity both stopped beyond `stall_after_min` plus any duration hint |
| 4 | `WATCHDOG: REPEAT` | the last four parsed command events were identical and need an intentional-vs-stuck ruling |

Use the LLM fallback only for backends where the orchestrator cannot launch a
background process whose exit wakes the loop.

## Status display

`skills/architect/status.ps1` (Windows) and `skills/architect/status.sh` (POSIX) read only run artifacts plus `gh`.
Piped output is plain text by design; callers print it verbatim instead of hand-composing status.

<!-- architect-monitor-fallback-template:start -->
```text
You are the detection-only fallback monitor for this dispatch wave. Use this
template only when the backend cannot wake the orchestrator from a background
watchdog process exit. You never kill, nudge, or decide - you only observe and
report evidence.

In-flight jobs:
- Issue #<n>, events <path>, report <docs/jobs/<issue-slug>-01.md>,
  worktree <path>, duration hint <hint or none>.
  (one line per job)

Sweep every ~10 minutes. For each job, check events/report byte growth,
process activity by command-line/worktree match, and repeated identical
commands in the tail. A quiet events file on a single sweep is normal model
thinking, not a stall.

Quiet exit is allowed ONLY when, for every job, you list the report path and
byte size as evidence. If a worktree or events file vanished because the
orchestrator integrated the job mid-sweep, exit `INTEGRATED_BY_ORCHESTRATOR`
and list the vanished path. If you cannot verify something from this sandbox,
state what you cannot verify instead of assuming the job is done.

Any stall or repeat concern exits immediately with the job id, minutes since
last growth, CPU/process activity evidence, repeated command if present, and
tail excerpt. Do not wait for other jobs to finish before reporting it.
```
<!-- architect-monitor-fallback-template:end -->

Codex backend note: `max_threads` is 6. Five builder jobs plus one monitor is
exactly at that cap only when the LLM fallback is used - never add a sixth
concurrent subagent while that fallback monitor is running.

## Duration hints and liveness

There are no per-command kill ceilings. Long test suites are legitimate work,
not stalls. Issue bodies and check files may carry duration *hints* (e.g.
"full suite ~ 20m") so the monitor does not flag a job early; a hint is
informative context for the monitor, never a ceiling anything enforces.

Sanctioned substitutions:

Executor truth for sandboxed jobs: MSYS2/Cygwin-runtime binaries (Git for
Windows `bash.exe`, `usr/bin/grep.exe`, `sed.exe`) die at startup under the
Codex Windows sandbox because Cygwin's named shared-memory `CreateFileMapping`
is denied with Win32 error 5 under the sandbox's dedicated-user restricted
token. Native `git.exe` and PowerShell are unaffected; POSIX/macOS/Linux
sandboxes are unaffected. Known upstream: openai/codex#12000 and
openai/codex#21715. Therefore check files name the platform-native executor
primary for sandboxed jobs: PowerShell + native git subcommands on Windows,
bash on POSIX; the recorded same-pattern substitution rule stays for
everything else.

| Condition | Substitution | Citation |
|---|---|---|
| Git Bash CreateFileMapping Win32 error 5 in Codex Windows sandbox | PowerShell + native git same-pattern, recorded per check | `docs/research/factory-hardening-evidence.md` |
| `uv` AppData cache denial (os error 5) | `UV_CACHE_DIR=.architect/tmp/uv-cache`, recorded | `docs/solutions/uv-cache-sandbox-redirect.md` |
| `gh` unavailable in sandbox | `MIRROR: ORCHESTRATOR` in the report | `docs/solutions/subagent-shell-strip-codex-fallback.md` |

## Orchestrator shell hygiene

Use absolute paths in every orchestrator shell command. Write dispatch,
judge, and config blocks with file tools, never heredocs. Never rely on a
persisted cwd across commands; run #30 lost three commands to current-directory
drift before this rule was written down.

Liveness is judged from report/output file growth plus process-tree
activity — never from wall-clock alone:

- Silent gaps between events are normal model thinking. A low context
  reading is not wedging; harnesses auto-compact and keep going.
- A job repeatedly issuing the same command or query with identical
  arguments is stalled even while its event/report file is still growing
  (the monitor's tail-of-output repeat-command check).
- A job is a genuine liveness concern only once its report/output file has
  stopped growing AND the process tree shows no activity, weighed against
  any duration hint the issue or check file carries.

On Windows PowerShell 5.1, `>`, `*>`, and `Tee-Object` write UTF-16. Liveness
and rescue checks over event files must read encoding-aware (`Get-Content`,
or `iconv` from UTF-16); byte-oriented grep can silently miss growth.

Known sandbox hang sources:

- `asyncio.create_subprocess_exec` and anything built on it: Playwright browser
  launch, anyio subprocess pools, and similar runtime harnesses. Plain
  `subprocess.run` works.
- Out-of-workspace temp paths under workspace-write. Prescribe
  `.architect/tmp/<purpose>` paths, `--basetemp .architect/tmp/<check-id>`, and
  in-workspace cache dirs.

## Respawn-with-answer template

Respawn-over-resume is the default recovery path (D7): a fresh builder
spawns into the same issue's job. Same-session resume is only for a harness
that supports live messaging while the existing session's context is still
young.

The respawn spawn block is built from four pieces:

1. The original issue body (task, boundaries, check pointer) — unchanged.
2. The orchestrator's answer or ruling — a blocker's answer, a failure
   diagnosis, or a rescue root cause — posted as an issue comment first (the
   issue is the durable log) and copied verbatim into the spawn context (the
   spawn context is the delivery channel; a running builder does not re-read
   issue comments).
3. What the previous session completed — read from its job report
   (`docs/jobs/<issue-slug>-01.md`) and the worktree's actual `git status` /
   `git diff`, never assumed from conversation.
4. Boundaries unchanged from the original issue: MAY TOUCH / MUST NOT TOUCH
   stay exactly as decomposed.

For a sandbox hang specifically (a wedged job that never gets to post a
blocker comment), this rescue ladder finds the root cause before respawn:

1. Kill stuck children first. On Windows, direct child lists can lie because
   wrappers die while grandchildren hold pipes. Search system-wide by command
   signature: executable path, test path, basetemp/cache directory, or another
   unique fragment from the in-flight command.
2. If a native background subagent repeats the same hang, stop that job and
   discard the worktree. Re-dispatch only after the issue text forbids the
   failing path or command.
3. If using the Codex backend path from Claude, resume only within the same
   job and same issue. Put global flags before `resume`; `-C` after `resume`
   is rejected. The thread id is in the first `thread.started` event.
4. If resume fails or hangs again, discard the job and respawn fresh from
   the frozen check file with the root cause named as forbidden.

Rescue/respawn block template:

```text
You are resuming issue #<n>. Do not redo completed edits; working-tree edits
survived unless the following command output proves otherwise.

Previous session completed (from docs/jobs/<issue-slug>-01.md and worktree
state): <summary of file:line evidence>.

Orchestrator's answer/ruling (also posted on issue #<n>):
<answer, diagnosis, or rescue root cause>.

Observed from outside the sandbox (sandbox-hang cases only):
- <event/report file path> stopped growing at <time>.
- Last in-progress command: <exact command>.
- Stuck child processes matched: <process list or search signature>.

Required route-around:
- Run exactly: <command with in-workspace temp/cache paths>.
- Run check commands sequentially only.
- The orchestrator reruns checks at judgment; record raw output and exact
  failures.

Boundaries remain:
- MAY TOUCH: <files>
- MUST NOT TOUCH: <files>
- Report path: docs/jobs/<issue-slug>-01.md
- End with exactly one STATUS line.
```

## Cross-model review

Use cross-model review for high-stakes slices: schema, API, persistence,
security, data loss, auth, or broad architectural changes. The reviewer's job
is to break confidence in the change with correctness, requirement, or
invariant gaps grounded in file:line evidence; no style nits.

Direction matters. In the one available study, Claude reviewing Codex output
helped, while Codex reviewing Claude output hurt. Prefer Claude-reviews-Codex
when the direction is choosable, and record the direction in the verdict
comment.

## Builder block template

```text
Execute the architect spec below. Operating rules:

PHASE 0 - Before any code: reply with your plan and EVERY disagreement you have
with this spec, with reasons, citing real files in this repo. Silent compliance
is a failure. Silent scope additions are a failure. If you have no
disagreements, state what you checked before concluding the spec is sound.
Verify the named APIs/formats/versions against the live dependencies before
planning around them.

PHASE 1 - The files under docs/checks/ are read-only at all times - editing
them fails the slice regardless of results.

PHASE 2 - Build YOUR JOB ONLY: exactly the files listed in BOUNDARIES. Job
shape is ship|scout. Job identity: you are job <slice>-<NN>; if the spec
says you are the only builder, no other job exists. Files outside your job
belong outside your authority - touching them fails your job. No placeholder
implementations - search the codebase before implementing; full
implementations only. No silent fallbacks or success-shaped defaults - never
swallow an error to make output look right. No unrequested backwards-
compatibility shims or dead compatibility code. Fail loudly, with context.
Exception: fallbacks or compat code are allowed only when the spec explicitly
requests them. Verify your work by running the job's check commands and
record the verbatim output. Do NOT commit - the sandbox protects .git by
design; the architect commits and merges after verification. Do NOT delete lock
files or escalate privileges if a git command fails; record the exact error and
continue.

SANDBOX EXECUTION POLICY - All temp, basetemp, and cache paths MUST be inside
the workspace (`.architect/tmp/<purpose>`); never the system temp. Run test/check
commands SEQUENTIALLY - never two invocations in flight at once. The spec or issue may declare duration hints for known-long commands (e.g. "full suite ~ 20m");
they are context, not kill ceilings. If a command appears stalled - no output
growth and no process activity well past its duration hint - record the exact
command and observed state in the job report and stop the job; the monitor
and orchestrator own stall handling. A filesystem/sandbox error on a path is
environmental: record the exact failure and route around it - never retry the same path.

When a known-bad pattern exists, the spec must name it as forbidden with
evidence and provide exact command forms, flags included. Failed attempts in
prior job reports are poisoned precedent unless explicitly marked forbidden.

When done, write your job report to docs/jobs/<issue-slug>-01.md with RAW
results only - tables, numbers, command output - no interpretation, no
"promising". Every status claim must be backed by a command result from this
run. Keep the report compact. Mirror your final STATUS line as a comment on
your issue when `gh` is available; when it is not, write
"MIRROR: ORCHESTRATOR" in the report instead and continue. End the report
with exactly one status line:
STATUS: COMPLETE | COMPLETE_WITH_CONCERNS (list them) | BLOCKED (exact blocker + what you tried).
Verdicts belong to the architect and the human. Persist until your job is
fully handled end-to-end.

=== OBJECTIVE (and why) ===
...

=== OUTPUT FORMAT ===
...

=== TOOL GUIDANCE (verification commands; verify-against-reality list) ===
...

=== BOUNDARIES (may touch / must not touch / out of scope) ===
...

=== DISAGREEMENT RULINGS (from last session) ===
...

=== ACCEPTANCE CHECKS (frozen at docs/checks/<slice>.md - read-only) ===

## Builder-side standing setup

- Builders never commit; the orchestrator does. Workspace-write protects `.git`
  as read-only in Codex on Windows, including worktree pointer resolution.
- Repo `AGENTS.md`: exact build/test commands and repo gotchas only. The
  loop's PHASE rules stay in the dispatch block so they version with the skill.
- Subscription quotas are per-window plus weekly cap. For unattended runs that
  must not die mid-run, use the harness-native paid or scheduled mechanism
  rather than repo-owned loop infrastructure.
