# Research fan-out reference

Read this only when a research trigger fires (see SKILL.md step 3). The fan-out
uses Claude subagents as parallel web-research workers — read-only, with web
search — and the architect keeps all judgment: it verifies the load-bearing
claims and writes the spec itself. If Codex CLI is available, it can be used
as an alternative backend.

## Fan out

Resolve the researcher model as builders, same order as `/architect`: repo
`.architect/config`, then user `~/.architect/config`, then the defaults
in `skills/architect/dispatch.md`.

Decompose the question into 3-5 narrow, NON-OVERLAPPING research questions.
Cover different angles, not the same angle five times — typical split:
official docs/reference, changelog/breaking changes, community failure reports,
alternatives/comparisons, security/operational constraints.

**Default (Claude-backend):** one fresh read-only Claude subagent per question,
all launched in parallel, in the background. Use the Agent tool with web search
enabled. The research block template below works verbatim as the subagent
prompt. The default researcher model is `claude/sonnet` (Sonnet at high effort)
— research is coverage work; frontier reasoning buys nothing here. Synthesis
happens on the architect's side.

**Codex-backend alternative** (when Codex CLI is on PATH and config resolves
to a codex row):

```bash
codex exec -C <repo-root> --sandbox read-only -c web_search="live" \
  -m gpt-5.5 -c model_reasoning_effort="high" \
  -o .architect/research/<NN>-<topic>.md \
  - < .architect/research/<NN>-<topic>.prompt.md
```

Write each research block to a `.prompt.md` file and pass it via stdin (`-`),
never as a shell argument — quote-mangling shells make codex hang waiting on
stdin otherwise. Launch ONE canary researcher and confirm it starts cleanly
before fanning out.

- Scope each researcher to ≤5 subjects and put hard context rules in the
  block (snippet over page; quote ≤2 sentences; stop the moment you can
  answer) — a researcher that fills its context window dies without writing
  its output file. Bisect and re-dispatch dead researchers; don't re-run as-is.

## Research block template

```
You are a web research agent. Answer ONE question. Do not write code, do not
make recommendations — judgment belongs to the architect who reads your output.

QUESTION: <one narrow question>

OUTPUT FORMAT — a markdown report, ≤ ~2,500 tokens (~10 KB) total:
- Findings as bullets. EVERY finding carries: a source tag (e.g. `[S3]`),
  source date (if shown), the exact figure or a short direct quote, and a
  confidence tag (high = primary source / med = reputable secondary / low =
  single blog or forum post).
- Prefer primary sources (official docs, changelogs, release notes, source
  code) over blog posts. Record exact version numbers and dates.
- When sources disagree, report the disagreement — do not resolve it.
- If you cannot find evidence for something, write NOT FOUND — never infer or
  fill gaps from prior knowledge without flagging it as such.
- End with a numbered source list — every source URL appears EXACTLY ONCE,
  numbered `[S1]`, `[S2]`, ... — then the 2-3 findings most likely to change
  an implementation decision.
```

## Gather (architect — this is your work, not another agent's)

1. Read every findings file in `.architect/research/`.
2. Identify the **load-bearing claims** — facts the spec will depend on
   (an API shape, a version constraint, a limit, a deprecation). Adversarially
   verify each: cross-check against a second independent source or the live
   dependency itself. Discard single-source low-confidence claims or mark them
   as open questions.
3. Write `docs/spec/<slice>.md`: problem, decision + why, requirements,
   non-goals, verified facts **with citations**, open questions for the human.
   You write it — researchers gather, the architect judges and decides.
4. Commit the spec. Raw findings stay in `.architect/research/` (gitignored) —
   only the distilled, cited spec is repo memory.
5. The slice spec references this spec instead of restating it; the builder's
   PHASE 0 is expected to challenge the spec's claims like anything else.
